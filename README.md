## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/sujalamati/SnakeGame)

This is a Snake Game built using C++. I have implemented core game mechanics including snake movement, collision detection, and fruit generation. I have implemented a fruit placement logic to ensure fruits spawn in valid locations, avoiding collisions with the snakeâ€™s tail.
